# Calypso Slot Finder

A small Python tool to look up available slots at my local swimming pool, Calypso 2000.
This tool scrapes the planning web page and prints a summary of the slots that are currently available.

## Example

```bash
python -m calypso.slot_finder
```

> 2 slot(s) open at the moment:
> Friday 12/03: 06:55 - 07:50: 5 place(s)
> Friday 19/03: 13:55 - 14:50: 1 place(s)
